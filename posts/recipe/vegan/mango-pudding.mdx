## More On This Recipe

I had bookmarked the recipe that eventually became this adaptation from About.com many years back.
The original recipe called for gelatin, but as a vegetarian, I needed to find a substitute.
Luckily, many years back I became aware of the incredible setting powers of an ingredient known
as agar agar.

Agar agar is a completely vegan ingredient that is derived from a particular kind of algae.
It is a perfect vegetarian substitute for gelatin, as it does a wonderful job helping liquids
to coagulate and thicken. So for all you vegetarians and vegans out there who have been missing
out on your favorite wobbly desserts, agar agar is your solution!

## How To Make Mango Pudding

### Make Mango Purée

1. First, rinse and then peel 2 medium-sized mangoes. Chop them and add to a mixer or blender jar. You will need 1.5 cups of chopped mangoes.
Be sure to use ripe and sweet mangoes, avoiding those that are fibrous. If you can’t get your hands on any good fresh mangoes, feel free to use frozen instead.
2. Then add 3 tablespoons of sugar. Feel free to add more or less, depending on the sweetness of the mangoes. Since the mangoes I used were very sweet, 3 tablespoons of unrefined cane sugar was sufficient.
3.  In a small pan, take 2 tablespoons chopped agar agar strands. Chop the strands as small as possible with scissors, as long strands are difficult to dissolve. If you are using powdered agar, you can skip this step.

### Make Mango Pudding
1. Wait for 20 seconds and then add the agar agar solution in the jar containing the mango puree. Scrape down the pan to get all of the agar agar solution into the mix.
2. Add ¾ cup of thick coconut milk (200 ml). You can add 1 cup instead of ¾ cup if you prefer a looser pudding consistency.
3. Pour the mango pudding mixture into serving bowls. Scrape the sides and bottom of the mixer jar with a spatula to get every last bit of goodness. Level the top layer of pudding with a spatula or the back of a spoon.

## FAQs
**Why isn’t my vegan pudding setting up properly?**
Do note that while using agar agar, it is important to boil either the strands or powder in water until they are fully dissolved. If you skip this step, then the pudding will not set.

**What are some other uses for agar agar?**
I have used agar agar in a few more recipes like my Mango Panna Cotta, Mango Cheesecake, and Pomegranate mousse.
