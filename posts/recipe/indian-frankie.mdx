## What is a Frankie?

Frankies are India’s flavorful street food, also known as the Mumbai Burrito, Bombay Burrito,  or roti wrap – this vegan version is filled with curry mashed potatoes, roasted Indian cauliflower and chickpeas, fresh spinach, Cilantro Mint Chutney and Pickled onions, all wrapped up in a warm tortilla.

Healthy and seriously bursting with flavor! Traditionally these would be wrapped in freshly made roti with a very thin layer of egg, but we’ve simplified things here a bit. 😉

In our catering business, we would often serve Frankies as mini tacos. Flavorful little Indian Tacos, always a huge hit!  If going grain-free or gluten-free, you could easily turn the whole thing into a “bowl”, with the curry mashed potatoes (or basmati rice) as the flavorful base.
